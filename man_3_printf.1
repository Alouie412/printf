.SH NAME
_printf - Formats and prints data based on given inputs

.SH SYNOPSIS

#include "holberton.h"

int _printf(const char * format, ...)

.SH DESCRIPTION
A _printf function that takes in argument(s) and prints them onto the console, as well as return the number of characters successfully printed using _printf. If given format, will replace the format with the appropriately supplied arguments if it exists. Each conversion specification is introduced by the character '%', and ends with a conversion specifier.

Conversion Specifiers

d, i	The int argument is converted to signed decimal notation.

o, u, x, X, b
	The unsigned int argument is converted to unsigned octal (o), unsigned decimal (u), unsigned binary (b), or unsigned hexadecimal (x and X) notation. The letters abcdef are used for x conversions, and ABCDEF for X conversions.

c	The int argument is converted to an unsigned char, and the resulting character is written.

s	The const char * argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer to a string). Characters from the array are written up to (but not including) a terminating null byte ('\0').

r	The const char * argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer to a string). Characters from the array are written in reverse order.

R	The const char * argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer to a string). Characters from the array are encrypted using rot13 and then printed

.SH RETURN VALUE
When the return is a success, the function returns the number of characters printed

If there is an output error encountered, a negative value is returned

.SH EXAMPLE
The following will output the string onto the console.

_printf("awesome");

The following will output the value onto the console.

_printf("%d", 525600);

The following will output the string in reverse onto the console.

_printf("%r", Hello Holberton);
